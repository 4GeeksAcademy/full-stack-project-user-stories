## How to start?

Under the guidance of your mentor you will form your project team. **Ideally, they should be teams of 3 people**, looking for motivation for the project to be carried out and the ability to collaborate. If you are learning on your own, it is advisable to look in online communities for other people to team up and do this type of projects and who are aligned with learning and improving their programming skills like you.

The goal is for teams to successfully reach the end of the project, combining **interest in the project** and **ability to develop interesting features** in the best possible way.

## Project Scope

One of the keys to the success of projects is that they are correctly defined and delimited according to the time available, the expected dedication and the team's capabilities.

> If the scope of the project is not well defined, it will result in a negative perception by the team for not achieving the objective, generating frustration and disillusionment.

### ‚òëÔ∏è A successful final project must include

- Good design and aesthetic presentation: we are not dedicated to design, but we must have criteria about what looks good and what does not, what is well aligned and built, or not, and for this, looking for references in other websites is essential.

- Registration, authentication and password reset.
  - [The password must be encrypted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/password-hashing-with-bcrypt-in-flask/), not in plain text, for security.

- A backend with a custom API to perform the transactions of your project.

- Have at least 3 more content views and an entire CRUD. For example:

  - Blog: Home, listing, article with comments....

  - E-commerce: Home, item listing, shopping cart, item detail...

- Integrate with one or more third party APIs, as well as leverage other libraries to improve the quality of the project and optimize development time.

- Be [deployed in production](<https://4geeks.com/docs/start/deploy-to-render-com>).

## üìùInstructions

Write the user stories of the product backlog of your final project. Remember that this list of user stories corresponds to the general features of the project, which will later be specified as tasks throughout the scrums.

Create a project in [Github Project](https://docs.github.com/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) and add your teammates. This is where the user stories of your product backlog should be. When all team members agree on the content of the stories and the scope of the project.
